                            <p>I am Farjana Islam. I am a front-end web developer. I don't like to define myself by the work i have done. I want to define myself by the work i want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself and do interesting things that matters. <br/> I love to design along with development. Eventually, I decided that it would be a fun challenge to try designing and building my own.</p><br/>
